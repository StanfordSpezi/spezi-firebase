## üéØ Three Proposed Approaches

### Approach 1: TypeScript-to-Zod Code Generation
```
Speed:         ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Fastest - automated)
Accuracy:      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   (Good - may miss FHIR specifics)
Type Safety:   ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Excellent)
Implementation: 1.5 weeks
```

**Summary**: Leverage existing TypeScript definitions from `@types/fhir` and use tools like `ts-to-zod` to automatically generate Zod schemas.

**Key Benefits**:
- Fastest implementation time
- Automated generation in seconds
- Minimal maintenance required
- Good type safety

**Trade-offs**:
- May miss FHIR-specific constraints
- Requires post-processing for accuracy
- External tool dependency

### Approach 2: FHIR Structure Definition (JSON) Based Generation
```
Speed:         ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  (Fast once built)
Accuracy:      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Highest - from official spec)
Type Safety:   ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Excellent)
Implementation: 6 weeks
```

**Summary**: Parse official FHIR R4B StructureDefinition JSON files to generate perfectly accurate Zod schemas.

**Key Benefits**:
- Highest accuracy possible
- Directly from FHIR specification
- Future-proof for new versions
- Comprehensive validation

**Trade-offs**:
- Longer initial development time
- Requires FHIR expertise
- Complex edge case handling

### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach with Schema Builder DSL
```
Speed:         ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  (Semi-automated)
Accuracy:      ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  (Very good)
Type Safety:   ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Excellent)
Implementation: 7 weeks
```

**Summary**: Create a domain-specific language (DSL) or builder pattern that simplifies manual schema creation.

**Key Benefits**:
- Best developer experience
- Incremental adoption possible
- High flexibility
- No external dependencies

**Trade-offs**:
- Still requires manual work
- Builder library needs maintenance
- Longer implementation than Approach 1

---

## üí° Recommendation: Hybrid Strategy

### Phase 1: Short-Term (Weeks 1-7)
**Implement Approach 3 (Builder DSL)**
- Provides immediate 40% productivity improvement
- Can be adopted incrementally
- No disruption to existing code
- Team-friendly learning curve

### Phase 2: Long-Term (Months 3-5)
**Develop Approach 2 (FHIR JSON Generation)**
- Achieves perfect FHIR compliance
- Eliminates manual maintenance
- Becomes single source of truth
- Future-proof solution

### Phase 3: Optional Fallback
**Approach 1 (TS-to-Zod) as Emergency Option**
- Available if quick results needed
- Can prototype rapidly
- Stepping stone to better solution
